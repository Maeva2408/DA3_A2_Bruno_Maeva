# Introduction

This analysis aimed at predicting the fast growth of firms between 2012 and 2014. This analysis could help an investor to decide to invest in a certain company or not.
The data we used was created by Bisnode, a major European business information company. The original dataset, bisnode-firms, contains the entire population of companies between 2005 and 2016 in Manufacturing (Electrical equiment, Motor vehicles, etc) and services (Accommodation and food and beverage services activities).

# Data

## Label engineering

The first step of this analysis was to define fast growth. To do so, we used the compound annual growth rate formula. 

CAGR = (Vfinal/Vbegin)^1/t - 1 


t being the time in years, we defined it as 2. 
It seems logic for us that if an investor took interest in a firm, he will be able only to invest the year later.
Vbegin is the Sales (€) in the year ongoing
Vfinal is the Sales (€) in the year +2

we converted in percentage.
we defined any firm that have a % CAGR of bigger or equal at 30% in two years as a fast growing firm, it means that they growth for 70% in two years.

## Sample design

Our sample is defined as 
- Firms still in business in 2012
- Firms that have sales between 10 000€ and 10 millions €

Our fast growing firms are compound annual growth percentage bigger or equal at 30% in two year

After having design our sample, we end up with 15692 companies and 2220 of them (14%) are fast growing.

## Feature engineering
#MAEVa
Now, We need to select our x variables and maybe transform them but before we need to clean them.
- Some of the variable are financial accounts (like inventories, current liabilities, etc), so per se they can't be negative, thus we decided to replace the negative value to 0.
- We created ratios , easier for interpretation and spotting extrem values
- we used the a method called winsorization 
- We elevated some variable to a quadratic function
- We took the log of sales.



```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

```
## Interaction
# Same as class 
We lookzd for interaction

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}



```
# Probability prediction and model selection


## Logit
```{r, include=F, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

```
# variables - tables
# Ratio EBITDA
# Show RMSE
# Choose the model




```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning= FALSE}

```

## Lasso

```{r, include=F, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}


```
# all variables
# comparing lasso to the best logit


## Random forest
```{r, include=F, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

```
# variable from our best logit model (take off the interaction)
# models

```{r, include=F, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

```

# Classification

```{r, include=F, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}


```


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
